## How to get the data
1. You need to download the sourse data from the below link and unzip it to your working directory.
2. You have to run the provided R script.

## Source data
As sourse data for this exercise, we have used the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description of the data set is available at the following link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Here is the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## R script
The file with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps:   
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
  1.1 Reading files    
    1.1.1 Reading trainings tables   
    1.1.2 Reading testing tables   
    1.1.3 Reading feature vector   
    1.1.4 Reading activity labels   
  1.2 Assigning column names   
  1.3 Merging all data in one set   
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement   
  2.1 Reading column names  
  2.2 Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation   
  2.3 Making nessesary subset from setAllInOne   
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names   
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject   
  5.1 Making second tidy data set   
  5.2 Writing second tidy data set in txt file   


## Variables:   
* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset.
